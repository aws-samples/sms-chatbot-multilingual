The proposed solution has the following features:

1. A campaign registration portal that can send confirmation message in the userâ€™s preferred language. The REST API can be protected by Amazon Cognito authorizer.
2. A QnA bot that responds to the transactional SMS message in the preferred language for a given phone number. QnA bot supports multiple languages.
3. An escalation outbound phone call can be initiated by the end of the clinical protocol evaluation, which can be transferred to different nursing line based on user preferred language.
4. Self-managed opt-ins and opt-outs are supported.
5. System automatically turns off campaign text messages for phone numbers according to a rolling time window, e.g. 14 days after opt-in
